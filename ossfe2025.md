## WarpX, a particle-in-cell code

Welcome to the WarpX tutorial at [OSSFE 2025](https://ossfe.github.io/)! üëã

[WarpX][warpx] is a general purpose **open-source** **high-performance** **Particle-In-Cell** (PIC) code.  
If you are not familiar with the PIC method, here is a picture that condenses the core idea:  

![Some computational particles (a.k.a. macroparticles) traveling in space, across the cells of a grid.](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/50726d37-2b72-4664-9435-f90d7d2f0043
){alt="macroparticles in the cells of a grid"}

And here is a more informative image that explains the core algorithmic steps.

![The loop at the basis of standard PIC codes.](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/659c0816-3c13-4375-b17d-03b894e17b93
){alt="pic loop"}

*  Browse our docs for [many more references about advanced algorithms and methods](https://warpx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theory/pic.html).

In this tutorial we will go through the **basics of WarpX**: installation, running a simple example and visualizing the results. 
Along the way, we will point to some specific locations in the documentation, for your reference.

Some cool features of WarpX:  

 üìñ Open-source - we wouldn't be here otherwise!  

 ‚úàÔ∏è Runs on GPUs: NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel  

 üöÄ Runs on multiple GPUs or CPUs, on systems ranging from laptops to supercomputers

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Installing WarpX using Conda-Forge

First, you need a **Conda** installation and we will assume that you indeed have one.  
If not, follow the [instruction at this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation).  
You can install Conda on most operative systems: **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.  
We will also assume you have some familiarity with the **terminal**. 
Once you have Conda on your system, **WarpX is available as a package** via [Conda-Forge](https://conda-forge.org/download/).  
The installation is a **one-liner** üòå!

::: callout
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge warpx 
```
:::

Ok, maybe two lines if you want to keep your system clean by creating a new **environment**. 

```bash
conda create -n warpx -c conda-forge warpx 
conda activate warpx 
```

Now you should have 4 different WarpX binaries in your `PATH` called `warpx.1d`, `warpx.2d`, `warpx.3d`, `warpx.rz`.  
Each binary for a different dimensionality.  

To check this, run:
```bash
which warpx.1d warpx.2d warpx.3d warpx.rz
```
If you get 3 different paths that look something like:
```bash
/home/<username>/anaconda3/envs/warpx/bin/warpx.xd
```
then you got this üôå! You can also import `pywarpx` in Python.


## A simple example of a magnetic mirror

In this example we will simulate a bunch of **protons inside a magnetic mirror machine**. 
The protons are initialized with random positions and velocities. 
The magnetic field is loaded from a `.h5` file.
Make sure to download the [input file](./files/inputs_3d_magnetic_mirror.txt). 

Whenever you need to prepare an input file, [this is where you want to go](https://warpx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/parameters.html).
By the way, analytics tell us that this is the most popular page of the documentation üë†!

### Let's take a look at the input file

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now that we have an idea of what the input files looks like, let's set up our environment.
Activate the `warpx` environment if you need to.
Create a new directory with your own copy of the input file. 
Also, don't forget to [download the field file](./files/example-femm-3d.h5) and place it in the directory where you will run the input. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Let's run the code

How would you do it? ü§∑

:::::::::::::::: solution

```bash
warpx.3d inputs_3d_magnetic_mirror.txt
```
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


You should see a standard output flashing out a lot of info.  
At the end, you should find in your folder:

  * a subfolder called `diags`: here is where the code stored the diagnostics  
  * a file called `warpx_used_inputs`: this is a summary of the inputs that were used to run the simulation  

If that's the case, yey! üíØ  

If the run went wrong, you may find a `Backtrace.0.0` file which can be useful for debugging purposes. 
Let me know if the code fails in any way! 

Here we have loaded the field of hte magnetic bottle from a file.
You can also you can [define an external field analytically](https://warpx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/parameters.html#applied-to-particles).


## Data handling and visualizations 

### With Python üêç

Now that we have the results, we can analyze them using Python.  
We will use the [openPMD-viewer][openpmd-viewer] library to grab the data that the simulation produced in `openPMD` format. 
Here you can find [a few great tutorials on how to use the viewer](https://openpmd-viewer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorials.html).
If you feel nerdy and/or you need to deal with the data in parallel workflows, you can use the [openPMD-api][opepmd-api].

As an example for the magnetic bottle simulation, we have developed simple Jupyter notebook where we retrieve the magnetic field 
and the particle attributes at the end of the simulation.
With a little bit more work, we also plot the trajectories of the particles.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Let's take a look at the Jupyter notebook

<iframe src="https://nbviewer.org/github/aeriforme/warpx-tutorials/blob/main/episodes/files/analysis_3d_magnetic_mirror.ipynb" 
           width="100%" height="800" style="border:none;">
     </iframe>
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


You can [download the notebook](./files/analysis_3d_magnetic_mirror.ipynb) and try it yourself.
Remember to either run the notebook from the simulation directory or change the corresponding path in the notebook.

### With Paraview

Now it's time to produce some pretty cool images and videos! üòé
If you don't have it, you can [download Paraview here](https://www.paraview.org/download/).
In the `diags/diag1` directory you should find a file named `paraview.pmd`: Paraview can read `.pmd` files.
Just open Paraview and from there open the `.pmd` file.
You should see `Meshes` and `Particles` in your pipeline browser (usually on the left).
We can zhuzh up the pipeline so that we can visualize the trajectories of the protons in time

This is the pipeline that I have used to produce the visualizations below.

If you make any other 3D visualization with this data, let me know! We can add it here üòâ!

And that's all for now! üëã
