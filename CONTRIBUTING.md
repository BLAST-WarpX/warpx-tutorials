## Contributing

WarpX Tutorials is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: 
new tutorials, fixes to existing material, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all
welcome.

### Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our
license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess
your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our
community. Everyone involved agrees to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### How to Contribute

1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by
   email][contact]. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use
   one of the other methods described below.

2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create
   one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems
   or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][repo-issues]. This allows us
   to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
   you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are
   [included below](#using-github). 

Note: if you want to build the website locally, please refer to [The Workbench
documentation][template-doc].

### What to Contribute

If you plan to prepare a class, lesson, workshop, exercize, or tutorial about WarpX, 
this is there right place to include it!

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new material and improving the
existing one, to submitting [bug reports][repo-issues] about things that do not work, are not clear, or are missing.

We will expand the WarpX tutorials as we develop new material for future events. 

### Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute] and 
[specifically to WarpX][warpx-how-contribute]. In brief, we
use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:  

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each
   significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].
5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
   branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.
