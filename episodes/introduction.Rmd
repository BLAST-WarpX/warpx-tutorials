## WarpX: an open-source high-performance particle-in-cell code 

[WarpX](https://github.com/BLAST-WarpX/warpx) is a general purpose Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code.  
If you are not familiar with the PIC method, here is a picture that condenses the core idea:  

If you want to know more, here are a few references:

In this tutorial we will go through the basics of WarpX: installation, running a simple example and visualizing the results. 
Along the way, we will point to the documentation for references.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: checklist

Some cool features of WarpX:  

*  Open-source - we wouldn't be here otherwise!
*  Runs on GPUs: NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel! 
*  Runs on multiple GPUs or CPUs, from laptops to supercomputers!
*  It has many options: 
    *  electrostatic, electromagnetic, magnetostatic
    *  mesh refinement
    *  embedded boundaries

## Installing WarpX using Conda-Forge

First, you need a Conda installation and we will assume that you indeed have one.
If not, follow the instruction at this [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation).  
You can install Conda on most operative systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
Once you have Conda on your system, WarpX is available as a package via [Conda-Forge](https://conda-forge.org/download/).  
It's a one-liner, no-brainer, small-potatoes üòå!

::: callout
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge warpx 
```
:::

Ok, maybe two lines if you want to keep your system clean by creating a new environment. 

```bash
conda create -n warpx -c conda-forge warpx 
conda activate warpx 
```

Now you should have 4 different WarpX binaries in your `PATH` called `warpx.1d`, `warpx.2d`, `warpx.3d`, `warpx.rz`.  
Each binary for a different dimensionality.  

To check this, run:
```bash
which warpx.1d warpx.2d warpx.3d warpx.rz
```
If you get 3 different paths that look something like:
```bash
/home/<username>/anaconda3/envs/warpx/bin/warpx.xd
```
then you got this üôå! You can also import `pywarpx` in `python`



## A simple example of a magnetic mirror

In this example we will simulate a bunch of protons inside a magnetic mirror machine. 
The protons are initialized with random positions and velocities. 
The magnetic field is loaded from a `.h5` file.
You can download the full input file from this [link](../files/inputs_3d_magnetic_mirror.txt)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### Let's take a look at the input file

```{r engine='bash', comment=''}
pwd
cat episodes/files/inputs_3d_magnetic_mirror.txt
cat https://github.com/aeriforme/warpx-tutorials/blob/main/episodes/files/inputs_3d_magnetic_mirror.txt

## Visualizing with Paraview

## Visualizing with python

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
