## Setup

In this example we will simulate a bunch of electrons colliding against a bunch of positrons.
We have selected the parameters of the C$^3$ linear collider, arbitrarily. 

Some notable details:

*  Poisson solver 

*  Resolution

*  Timestep 

*  QED lookup tables

*  Diagnostics


Whenever you need to prepare an input file, [this is where you want to go](https://warpx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/parameters.html).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### Let's take a look at the input file

```{r engine='bash', echo=FALSE, comment=''}
cat ./files/inputs_3d_beambeam_C3.txt
```

## Run 

::: caution

Coming soon. For now, [refer to the main documentation][warpx-readthedocs].

## Visualize

### With Python üêç

Now that we have the results, we can analyze them using Python.  
We will use the [openPMD-viewer][openpmd-viewer] library to grab the data that the simulation produced in `openPMD` format. 
Here you can find [a few great tutorials on how to use the viewer](https://openpmd-viewer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorials.html).
If you feel nerdy and/or you need to deal with the data in parallel workflows, you can use the [openPMD-api][openpmd-api].

As an example for the magnetic bottle simulation, we have developed simple Jupyter notebook where we retrieve the magnetic field 
and the particle attributes at the end of the simulation.
With a little bit more work, we also plot the trajectories of the particles.

 üíÖ There are several details one needs to take care when setting up a beam-beam simulation

 üîç The [**documentation**][warpx-readthedocs] is the first place to look for answers, 
 otherwise check out our [**issues**][warpx-issues] and [**discussions**][warpx-discussions] and ask there.  

 üì∑ To analyze and visualize the simulation results in [**openPMD**][openpmd] format, 
 you can use the [**openPMD-viewer**][openpmd-viewer] library for Python.
