## Overview of PIC  

[WarpX][warpx] is a general purpose **open-source** **high-performance** **Particle-In-Cell** (PIC) code.   
The PIC method is a very popular approach to **simulate the dynamics of physical systems governed by relativistic electrodynamics**.
**Plasmas ‚≠ê and beams ‚òÑÔ∏è**, which are often made of charged particles that may travel almost at the speed of light, fall into this category.
Additionally, other physical effects can be integrated into the PIC algorithm, such as different **quantum** üé≤ processes.

Here is a picture that condenses the core idea: there are _particles_ and _fields_.
The particles are approximated as _macroparticles_ (usually each representative of many real particles), while the fields are approximated on a _grid_ in space.
The particles and the fields are updated, self-consistently, in a temporal loop.

){alt="macroparticles in the cells of a grid"}

Here is a more informative image that explains the core algorithmic steps.
As the particles travel in space, they generate currents, which in turn generate an electromagnetic field. 
The electromagnetic field then push the particles via the Lorentz force. 
Therefore, the current density $\textbf{J}$ and the force $\textbf{F}_L$ are the quantitieis that connect the particles and the fields, or in PIC lingo, the macroparticles and the grid.
Hence, the idea is the following.
First, define a well-posed initial condition, and then iterate the following:
* Interpolate the fields from the grid to the particles' positions and compute the Lorentz force that acts on each macroparticle,
* Advance the position and momenta of the macroparticles using Newton equations,
* Project while cumulating the contribution to the current density of each macroparticles,
* Solve Maxwell's equations.

In some cases, one can choose to solve Poisson's equation instead of Maxwell's. 
In that case, the current $\textbf{J}$ calculation is replaced with the charge density $\rho$ calculation.
Once $\rho$ is known, the electrostic potential is computed to then find the electric field.
